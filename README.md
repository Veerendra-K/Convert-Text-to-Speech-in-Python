# Convert-Text-to-Speech-in-Python
- <strong>Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio with a button click or finger touch. Text to speech python project is very helpful for people who are struggling with reading.</strong></br>


# Project Prerequisites
- To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.

  - Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
  - gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.
  - The playsound module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound file with a single line of code.
  
    # To install the required libraries, you can use pip install command:
  
                 pip install tkinter
                 pip install gTTS
                 pip install playsound
    
    
  # Text to Speech Python Project
  -  The objective of this project is to convert the text into voice with the click of a button. This project will be developed using Tkinter, gTTs, and playsound library.

  -  In this project, we add a message which we want to convert into voice and click on play button to play the voice of that text message.

           * Importing the modules
           * Create the display window
           * Define functions

<h1>Summary</h1>
<strong>We have successfully developed the text to speech python project. We used the popular tkinter library for rendering graphics on a display window, gTTs (google text to speech) library to convert text to voice, and playsound library to play that converter voice from the text.</strong>
